        Below are some placeholder projects. These will later be replaced with
        real, professional-grade projects aligned with Crossover standards.
      </p>

      <section style={{ marginTop: "1.5rem" }}>
        <h2>⚙ Placeholder Project 1</h2>
        <p>
          A simple project description. This will eventually become a real 
          full-stack or frontend project.
        </p>

        <h2>⚙ Placeholder Project 2</h2>
        <p>
          Another placeholder. We just need structure for now.
        </p>
      </section>
