      <p>
        Hi, I’m Felix Frimpong — an aspiring full-stack engineer focused on
        building clean, scalable, and high-quality software. I’m currently
        learning modern web development and preparing to meet the strong
        engineering standards required by Crossover.
      </p>

      <p>
        My long-term goal is to become a world-class remote engineer, mastering
        technologies like JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and modern cloud tools.
      </p>

      <p>
        This portfolio showcases my projects as I progress through my software
        engineering journey.
